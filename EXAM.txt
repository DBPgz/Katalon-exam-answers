EXAM OPTIMIZE YOUR AUTOMATION SKILLS


GENERAL

The System Under Test (SUT) is http://automationpractice.com/index.php.  This
is really a nice fake e-commerce site to practice test automation.  If you
have a project where you need to practice different flows for online stores,
this is the website you want. All exercises must be executed within Katalon
Studio and of course you should create test cases, test suites and so on.

Use the URL https://github.com/gpaulissen/katalon-exam to clone a Git project.


EXERCISE 1 - Create an address

Detailed steps:

- Go to the site http://automationpractice.com/index.php and Sign Up the first time.
  Please note your username (email) and password.

- Use the Record Web to just Sign In. Stop the recorder.

- Change the global variables loginUsername and loginPassword to your email
  and encrypted password. See the script created by Record Web to retrieve the encrypted password.

- Go to the url http://automationpractice.com/index.php?controller=addresses.
  Use the existing test case Common/GoToUrl to go to the Url and login as necessary:

    WebUI.callTestCase(findTestCase('Common/GoToUrl'), ['url' : GlobalVariable.loginUrl + '?controller=addresses'])

- Click the button Add a new address and fill in the details.
  Use variables.

- Create an internal spreadsheet in the Data Files directory with all the
  information you entered. Repeat this five times.

- Create a Test Suite and use the data driven
  approach to combine the spreadsheet and the test case.
