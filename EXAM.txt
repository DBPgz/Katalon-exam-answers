EXAM OPTIMIZE YOUR AUTOMATION SKILLS


GENERAL

The System Under Test (SUT) is http://opensource.demo.orangehrmlive.com. This
is a test site and you can do there whatever you want. All exercises must be
executed within Katalon Studio and of course you should create test cases,
test suites and so on. The Katalon Studio project should be stored as a
project in your personal GitHub account, so it can be verified later on.

Login with Admin and create 5 employees: first name "pizza" and last name
"employee_X_Y_Z" where X is the number of the pizza session, Y your user

after the creation.


EXERCISE 2 - PIM -> Delete employees
